Development setup for Eclipse, using Maven:


1) Check out the entire Moria tree from CVS.

2) For each module in the modules directory, run 'maven eclipse'.
   Alternatively, do a 'maven project:eclipse' in the main project's root directory.
   

3) Set MAVEN_REPO variable in Eclipse (global; 
   Window->Preferences->Java->Build Path->Classpath Variables)
   and point it to  the Maven repository (default ~/.maven/repository).

4) Import each module as a project in Eclipse.


Note for users of Maven 1.0
---------------------------
The message

 Plugin 'maven-deploy-plugin' in project '{insert project here}' is not available

when building modules can be ignored, as it is caused by a "feature" in this version of Maven.
