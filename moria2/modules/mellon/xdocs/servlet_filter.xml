    <section name="Servlet Filter">
        
        <p>
            This chapter will describe a sample servlet filter, that provides
            authentication and attribute retrieval using the <a href="index.html">Mellon2 API</a>.
            The actual steps taken are identical to those for <a href="../howto_service_interactive.html">interactive authentication</a>.
            Ticket-based SSO is not supported, and exceptions are not trapped
            (that is, they are thrown as <tt>ServletException</tt>s from the
            filter).
        </p>
        <p>
            For more on servlet filters, please read <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/Filters.html">this</a>
            article.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that this filter implementation has been designed to be
            as <b>backwards compatible</b> with the corresponding Mellon1
            servlet filter as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            More information may be found in the servlet filter's <a href="apidocs\no\feide\mellon\filter\AuthenticationFilter.html">JavaDoc</a>.
        </p>

            <p>
                The Mellon2 Java client-side API contains both the Java API
                itself and the servlet filter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please refer to the Mellon2 API <a href="index.html#Download">download</a>
                section.
            </p>

        <subsection name="Configuration">
            <p>
                A number of configuration properties are available for use with
                the Mellon2 servlet filter. Some of these are <b>optional</b>, while
                others are <b>required</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A configuration property can be set using one of three methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        By defining it as a <b>system property</b>. This takes
                        precedence over the two methods below.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By setting it in the <b>servlet filter's configuration.</b>
                        This takes precedence over the method below. Please
                        refer to your servlet container's documentation for how
                        to do this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By setting it in a <b>configuration</b> file. This file
                        should be placed in the servlet's <b>root folder</b>; if
                        your servlet container unpacks the servlet's WAR file in
                        a folder <tt>CONTAINER_HOME/webapps/myservlet</tt>, the
                        file should ble placed in <tt>CONTAINER_HOME/webapps/myservlet/WEB-INF/classes</tt>.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                The following configuration properties are available for use
                with the Mellon2 servlet filter.
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Property</th>
                        <th>Required</th>

                    <tr>
                        <td>no.feide.mellon.servicePassword</td>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>no.feide.mellon.endpoint</td>
                        <td>Yes</td>
                        <td>The SOAP v2.1 service endpoint of the Moria2
                            instance you are using. Please refer to <a href="../howto/service/feide.html">this</a>
                            section for a list of service endpoints provided by
                            <a href="http://www.feide.no">FEIDE</a>.</td>

                With the exception of <tt>no.feide.mellon.endpoint</tt>, this
                list is identical to the Moria1 configuration properties.
