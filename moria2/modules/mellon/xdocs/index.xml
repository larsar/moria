        <subsection name="Overview">
            <p>
                The only officially supported service interface to Moria2
                remains the <b>SOAP interface</b> defined by the published
                WSDLs. However, to ease the service integration process, a
                ready-to-use client-side API is also made available. This
                library is called <b>Mellon2</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may or may not publish Mellon2 APIs for other languages than
                Java; refer to the Moria2 <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78969">file list</a>
                for a current list of available Mellon2 APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that all published Mellon2 APIs are considered <b>example code</b>
                only, to be used at your own risk.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please refer to the Moria2 <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78969">file list</a>
                for available releases of the Mellon2 client-side API.
                Alternatively, Mellon2 can be built from the code available from
                the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=78969">CVS</a>
                repository.

        <subsection name="Mellon2 Java">
            <p>
                The Mellon2 Java client-side API consists of <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/">Axis</a>-generated
                client stubs, with a <b>wrapper class</b> hiding most of the
                stub-specific details. The wrapper class is designed to be as
                similar to the previous Mellon1 equivalent as possible, and is
                the primary Mellon2 Java interface service developers should
                use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please refer to the <a href="apidocs/index.html">JavaDoc</a> for
                more information. JavaDoc for the wrapper class can be found
                <a href="apidocs/no/feide/mellon/Moria.html">here</a>.
