# Answers for question 1.
answer1_1=To be able to log in, there are five requirements:
answer1_2=The organisation where you belong must have an agreement with
answer1_owner=FEIDE (Moria's controlling organization in Norway)
answer1_3=You need a valid user account from the organization where you belong
answer1_4=You need to supply your username (which is the same as you use to log in locally) 
answer1_5=You need to supply the name of the organization where you belong
answer1_6=You need to supply your correct password. Please make sure that CAPS LOCK is not on.
answer1_7=On the login page, please enter your username, password and organization name in the form \
which is located on the left side of the page.


# Answers for question 2.
answer2_1= You'll get this error message if Moria cannot determine which \
web service you are trying to log in to. This is caused by one of the following situations.

answer2_2=Maximum login time exceeded
answer2_3=You need to complete the login page within a few minutes. If you wait too long,\
Moria will have deleted all information about the login attempt, and will therefore serve \
an error message.

answer2_4=Using a bookmark or link to the login page
answer2_5=It is only possible to log in to a service from that service's web pages, and not
from the login page, which is hosted by FEIDE/Moria. If you follow a link or a bookmark to the login-page, Moria \
will not know which service you want to log in to.

answer2_6=The login page has reloaded
answer2_7=Due to security reasons, every login session uses its own unique identification. If you reload the page (e.g., by pressing "Refresh"), \
the session identification will no longer be valid.
answer2_8=The only solution to this problem is also very easy: go to the web service you want to use and try logging in again.


# Answers for question 3.
answer3_1=The login page exists in the following languages: \
Norwegian Bokm&aring;l, Norwegian Nynorsk and English. The service you are trying to log in to determines the default \
langague of the login-page. You can specify your preferred order of languages in your web browser or you can explicitly \
select a different language at the top of the login page.

# Answers for question 0 (last).
answer0_1=Please check the status page
answer0_2=for Moria
answer0_3=.
answer0_4=If you can't what figure out what is causing your problem, or haven't found your an answer or solution on this page, please contact \
your local system administrator.
