# Answers for question 1.("Login requirements")
answer1_1=To be able to log in, there are five requirements:
answer1_2=The organisation where you belong must have an agreement with
answer1_owner=FEIDE (Moria's controlling organization in Norway)
answer1_3=You need a valid user account from the organization where you belong
answer1_4=You need to supply your username (which is the same as you use to log in locally) 
answer1_5=You need to supply the name of the organization where you belong
answer1_6=You need to supply your correct password. Please make sure that CAPS LOCK is not on.
answer1_7=On the login page, please enter your username, password and organization name in the form \
which is located on the left side of the page.


# Answers for question 2.  ("Unknown ticket")
answer2_1= You'll get this error message if Moria cannot determine which \
web service you are trying to log in to. This is caused by one of the following situations.

answer2_2=Maximum login time exceeded
answer2_3=You need to complete the login page within a few minutes. If you wait too long,\
Moria will have deleted all information about the login attempt, and will therefore serve \
an error message.

answer2_4=Using a bookmark or link to the login page
answer2_5=It is only possible to log in to a service from that service's web pages, and not \
from the login page, which is hosted by FEIDE/Moria. If you follow a link or a bookmark to \
the login-page, Moria will not know which service you want to log in to.

answer2_6=The login page has reloaded
answer2_7=Due to security reasons, every login session uses its own unique identification. If you reload the page (e.g., by pressing "Refresh"), \
the session identification will no longer be valid.
answer2_8=The only solution to this problem is also very easy: go to the web service you want to use and try logging in again.


# Answers for question 3.("wrong language!")
answer3_1=The login page exists in the following languages: \
Norwegian Bokm&aring;l, Norwegian Nynorsk and English. The service you are trying to log in to determines the default \
language of the login page. You can specify your preferred order of languages in your web browser or you can explicitly \
select a different language in the language menu.

answer3_2=Language settings for some popular browsers are found in this way:
answer3_opera=Opera v7: Choose "Tools->Preferences..." and select your preferred language in the "Language" pulldown menu located on the "General"-tab
answer3_firefox:Firefox v1: Choose "Tools->Options..." and press the "Languages" button under the "General"-area
answer3_ie:Internet Explorer v6: Choose "Tools->Internet Options..." and press the "Languages" button on the "General"-tab

#Answers for question 4. ("is it safe?") 
answer4_1=Yes, this page is safe to use. Your host organization is trusting FEIDE to control the safety of \
the login function, and it has opened for you and everybody else from \
your organization to use the exact service you are trying to log in \ 
to. FEIDE, on the other hand, is trusting that you are the one you \ 
claim to be, through a trust in your host organization's systems and \
routines for managing personal information.

answer4_2=This mutual trust is also written down in a contract between FEIDE and your host organization. \
The technical security of the login page is explained on a

#Answers for question 5: ("My org. is not listed")
