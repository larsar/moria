            <p>
            The Configuration Manager reads and watches the configuration files
            for all modules. When a module's configuration file is changed, the
            Configuration Manager pushes the updated configuration to the
            relevant module. Configuration files for all modules can be changed
            during runtime without restart of Moria, but changes in the base
            configuration (that is, the Configuration Manager's config file)
            requires a full restart of Moria.
            </p>
            <p>
            All file paths can be given as a full path or relative to the
            location of the base configuration file.
            </p>
            <p>
            Example Configuration Manager configuration file:
            </p>
