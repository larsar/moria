		Moria is the authentication service for the Norwegian FEIDE
		(<b>F</b>ederated <b>E</b>lectronic <b>IDE</b>ntity) project.
		</p>
		<p>
		The source code is distributed under the
		<a href="license.html">GNU General Public License</a>; software and

		SourceForge.net

		<subsection name="A Note on Versioning">
			<p>
			Following the versioning structure introduced with the second-generation
			Moria implementation, all previous and current Moria versions follow
			the naming convention Moria<i>G</i> v<i>X</i>.<i>Y</i>, where <i>G</i>
			is the generation number, and <i>X</i>.<i>Y</i> denote the major and
			minor SOAP interface version, respectively.
			</p>
			<p>
			Thus, the first production version of the Moria software will from
			now on be known as Moria1 v0.9, while the earliest second-generation
			version is known as Moria2 v2.1. The SOAP interface version will
			only be used when relevant, as will the generation number.
			</p>
			<p>
			Thus, Moria is the authentication system itself, Moria2 is the
			second-generation implementation of this system, and Moria2 v2.1 is
			the second-generation implementation using the 2.1 version of the
			SOAP interface.
