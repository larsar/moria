            <p>
            The Mellon Demo configuration contains properties used to set up
            an <em>optional</em> demonstration service against a Moria
            installation. This may be useful to check your Moria configuration,
            or to demonstrate the Moria functionality with a fictional, but
            working, client service.
            </p>
            <subsection name="Base Configuration">
	            <p>
	            The Mellon Demo is dependent on an inital property which has to be
	            specified as system properties in the VM (or classloader, if your
	            application server supports this functionality):
	            </p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>
	                <pre>no.feide.mellon.demo.config</pre>
	                Should point to the Mellon Demo's configuration property file.
	                Example:
	                <pre>no.feide.mellon.demo.config=/full/path/demo.properties</pre>
	                </li>
	            </ul>
	            <p>
	            This example starts <a href="http://www.caucho.com/">Resin</a> with
	            the required property:
	            </p>
	            <source>
$ cd $RESIN_HOME/bin
$ httpd \
> -Dno.feide.mellon.demo.config=/config/demo.properties</source>

            <subsection name="Configuration File">
                <p>
                The configuration properties required in the Mellon Demo
                configuration file are as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <code>no.feide.mellon.demo.serviceEndpoint</code>
                    <p>
                    The service endpoint. The example file below assumes Moria
                    is deployed locally, and will use version 2.0 of the SOAP
                    interface.
                    </p> 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <code>no.feide.moria.web.demo.master.attributeRequest</code>
                    <p>
                    A comma-separated list of attributes requested by the master
                    (in the
                    <a href="config_authorization_manager.html#Authorization Manager">Authorization Manager</a>
                    referred to as a "service") demo service. The example file
                    below will cause the demo servlet to request the attributes
                    <i>someAttribute</i> as well as the virtual (meaning it
                    doesn't exist physically in the actual user element)
                    attribute <i>tgt</i>, which is the ticket granting ticket.
                    If this property is not set, no attributes are requested
                    (effectively an empty array).
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <code>no.feide.moria.web.demo.master.username</code>
                    <p>
                    The username used by the demo servlet to access Moria as a
                    master (in the
                    <a href="config_authorization_manager.html#Authorization Manager">Authorization Manager</a>
                    referred to as a "service") client service. The application
                    server's user database must be configured accordingly.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <code>no.feide.moria.web.demo.master.password</code>
                    <p>
                    The password used by the demo servlet to access Moria as a
                    master (in the
                    <a href="config_authorization_manager.html#Authorization Manager">Authorization Manager</a>
                    referred to as a "service") client service. The application
                    server's user database must be configured accordingly.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <code>no.feide.moria.web.demo.slave.attributeRequest</code>
                    <p>
                    A comma-separated list of attributes requested by the slave
                    (in the
                    <a href="config_authorization_manager.html#Authorization Manager">Authorization Manager</a>
                    referred to as a subservice) demo service. The example file
                    below will cause the demo servlet to request the attribute
                    <i>anotherAttribute</i>. If this property is not set, no
                    attributes are requested (effectively an empty array).
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <code>no.feide.moria.web.demo.slave.username</code>
                    <p>
                    The username used by the demo servlet to access Moria as a
                    slave (in the
                    <a href="config_authorization_manager.html#Authorization Manager">Authorization Manager</a>
                    referred to as a "subservice") client service. The
                    application server's user database must be configured
                    accordingly.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <code>no.feide.moria.web.demo.slave.password</code>
                    <p>
                    The password used by the demo servlet to access Moria as a
                    slave (in the
                    <a href="config_authorization_manager.html#Authorization Manager">Authorization Manager</a>
                    referred to as a "subservice") client service. The
                    application server's user database must be configured
                    accordingly.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <code>no.feide.mellon.demo.logout.url</code>
                    <p>
                    The name of the parameter used to contain the redirect URL
                    when logging out. Explicitly included for example purposes,
                    although it could possibly be derived from
                    <code>no.feide.mellon.demo.serviceEndpoint</code>.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                The following configuration properties for the Mellon Demo
                are optional:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <code>no.feide.mellon.demo.trustStore</code>
                    <p>
                    The filename of an optional truststore, used when Mellon
                    uses a Moria instance with a certificate that cannot be
                    trusted using the JVM's default truststore. If this
                    parameter is not set, the JVM default truststore is used
                    instead.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <code>no.feide.mellon.demo.trustStorePassword</code>
                    <p>
                    The password used to access the optional Mellon truststore.
                    Should be specified if a password protected custom
                    truststore file is specified.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <p>     
            Example Mellon Demo configuration file, using a locally deployed
            Moria. Note that this example requires a suitably configured
            Moria Authorization Manager (see the
            <a href="config_authorization_manager.html">Authorization Manager</a>
            documentation).
