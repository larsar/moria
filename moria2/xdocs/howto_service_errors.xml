		<section name="Error Handling">
			<p>
			This section will outline how errors are distributed from Moria to
			the client service through the SOAP interface. For more information
			please refer to the <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/index.html">Axis</a>
			documentation regarding server-side exception handling.
			</p>
			<p>
			The information below is currently only valid for the v2.1 of the
			SOAP interface (and upwards). The v2.0 interface will use the more
			generic <code>RemoteException</code>s, where the actual
			<i>faultcode</i> (see below) will always be <i>Server</i> and the
			<i>faultstring</i> will include the Java exception cause.
			</p>
			<subsection name="SOAP Faults">
				<p>
				The SOAP Fault message from Moria will be on the form shown
				below:
				<source>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"&gt;
	&lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
		&lt;SOAP-ENV:Fault&gt;
			&lt;faultcode&gt;Client&lt;/faultcode&gt;
			&lt;faultstring&gt;AUTHORIZATION FAILED&lt;/faultstring&gt;
		&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Fault&gt;
	&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;</source>
				In this example, the <i>faultcode</i> element shows that this
				was caused by the client (that is, the Moria-enabled client
				service using a SOAP operation). The <i>faultstring</i>, using a
				set of pre-defined error strings, shows that in this case, the
				client service was not authorized to perform the requested
				SOAP operation.
				</p>
                <p>
                These are the possible values and combinations for the
                <i>faultcode</i> and <i>faultstring</i> elements, with
                descriptions:
				<table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>faultcode</th>
