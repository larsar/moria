		<section name="From Moria1 to Moria2">
			<p>
			In this section we will briefly describe the changes between the
			previous and current generations of Moria, and outline the steps
			necessary to migrate a Moria-enabled service to the current
			generation of Moria.
			</p>
			<p>
			The previous generation of the Moria system will be called Moria1
			while the current will be called Moria2.
			</p>
			<subsection name="Differences Between Moria1 and Moria2">
				<p>
				There are basically three differences between Moria1 v0.9 and
				the first Moria2 v2.1 release:
				<ul>
				    <li>
				    The SOAP interface has been reworked; versioning of the
				    interface has been added, the methods have been renamed, and
				    an improved error handling has been integrated into the SOAP
				    interface.
				    </li>
					<li>
					Support for direct, non-interactive authentication; services
					may collect user credentials themselves and authenticate/
					retrieve user attributes without the need for a HTTP
					redirect (if so allowed by Moria2).
					</li>
					<li>
					Support for ticket based single sign-on; a service, on
					successfully authenticating a user, may request a ticket
					granting ticket and generate proxy tickets for other
					services. These so-called subservices may then use the proxy
					tickets to authenticate the user directly, as well as
					requesting user attributes.
					</li>
				</ul>
				For more details on the new Moria2 interface, please refer to
				the service integration
				<a href="howto_service_overview.html">documentation</a>.
                </p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Migrating From Moria1 to Moria2">
				<p>
				For those accustomed to the Moria1 SOAP interface, the migration
				to Moria2 is as simple as:
				<ol>
					<li>
					Generating new client-side stubs with your SOAP library of
					choice, based on the new WSDL.
					</li>
					<li>
					Changing your code to match the similar, but renamed methods
					(which will give stub methods with different names than you
					might be used to).
					</li>
				</ol>
				For those who have been using the pre-compiled Mellon
				client-side API with Moria1 v0.9 as deployed by the
				<a href="http://www.feide.no">FEIDE</a> project (included in the 
				<code>feide-mellon-api-prod-0.9.jar</code> file), or the
				matching servlet filter (included in the
				<code>feide-mellon-filter-prod-0.9.jar</code> file), we
				currently have no similar ready-to-use client-side API
				available for Moria2. Please check the
				<a href="http://www.feide.no">FEIDE</a> pages for updates.
				</p>
				<p>
				However, keep in mind that the official, and only supported,
				interface to Moria (all versions) is the interface presented
				through the WSDL. All other client-side APIs or modules are
				considered example code, to be used at your own risk.
                </p>
