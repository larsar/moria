            <p>
            Moria is dependent on three inital properties which has to be
            specified as system properties in the VM (or classloader, if your
            application server supports this functionality). The three are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                <pre>no.feide.moria.configuration.base</pre>
                Should point to the Configuration Manager's base property file.
                Example:
                <pre>no.feide.moria.configuration.base=/full/path/base.properties</pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                <pre>Dno.feide.moria.store.nodeid</pre>
                The JBossCache node ID for this instance. A unique (in the
                JBossCache cluster's context; see the 
                <a href="#Store Manager">Store Manager</a> section) 
                three-character alphanumeric string. Example:
                <pre>Dno.feide.moria.store.nodeid=xy1</pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                <pre>log4j.configuration</pre>
                Log4j's configuration file (optional). Example:
                <pre>log4j.configuration=/full/path/log4j.xml</pre>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            The last property may be considered optional as log4j on
            initialization has its own regime of locating its configuration, but
            this is the preferred way to do it when using Moria.
            </p>

            This example starts <a href="http://www.caucho.com/">Resin</a> with
            the required properties:

$ cd $RESIN_HOME/bin
$ httpd \
