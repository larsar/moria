                This chapter outlines the currently available SOAP interface
                versions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most service developers should use the <b>v2.1</b> interface,
                unless you encounter problems with <a href="http://www.ws-i.org/">WS-I Basic Profile</a>
                compliance. If so, use the v2.2 interface.
		    </p>
            <p>
                The v2.0 interface should be considered obsolete, but is still
                included for backwards compatibility.
            </p>

                            The original basic SOAP interface, more or less a
                            direct port from the  v1.0 SOAP interface of Moria1.

                            Improves on the v2.0 interface by adding proper
                            error handling (as described in the

                            overview), as well as methods to support 
                            ticket-based SSO (as described in the
                            <a href="howto_service_sso.html">Single Sign On</a>
                            overview).

                            v2.2

                        <td>
                            Functionally identical to the v2.1 interface, but
                            conforms to
                            <a href="http://www.ws-i.org/">WS-I Basic Profile 1.0</a>.
                            In order to facilitate this through the limitations of
                            <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/">Axis</a>, there
                            is some added complexity to the SOAP encoding of
                            multi-valued attributes. Each attribute now contains
                            a string field named <tt><i>separator</i></tt>, and the
                            values are represented as a single string field.
                            Each value in this field is separated by the
                            aforementioned separator string, and any natural
                            occurrences of the separator in a value is encoded
                            as two subsequent occurrences of the separator
                            string. The separator string is on the form
                            <tt>_abcd_</tt>, where <tt>abcd</tt> is a random
                            four-letter sequence in lowercase. For single-valued
                            attributes no separator is used.
