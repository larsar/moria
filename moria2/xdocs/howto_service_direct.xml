		<section name="Direct Authentication">
			<p>
                This chapter will describe the authentication method
                <b>direct non-interactive authentication</b>. It is called
                direct because Moria2 does not handle the user's credentials;
                this is received directly from the service. This method is
                useful for services that are not web-based/have no possibility
                to handle redirects.
            </p>
            
            <subsection name="Step-by-Step Overview">
                <p>
                    These are the basic steps involved in a direct
                    non-interactive authentication.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The user attempts to access some protected content
                            provided by a Moria2-enabled web service.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The service receives the user's credentials. The
                            username is on the form <b><i>localID</i>@<i>organization</i></b>,
                            where <i>localID</i> is the local username assigned
                            to the user by his or hers home organization <i>organization</i>.
                            Exactly how the service receives these credentials
                            is up to the service implementation.

                            The service contancts Moria2 and requests a <b>direct
                            non-interactive authentication</b> session. The service
                            will usually also request one or more user
                            attributes.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Moria2 checks the request against the stored service
                            profile. If the request is valid then the user's
                            credentials are checked.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Given that step 4 completes successfully, Moria2
                            returns the <b>requested attribute values</b>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The service now has the necessary information to
                            authorize the user (or not, as the case may be) to
                            access the protected content.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Note that in this case, the service will only need to
                    perform a single SOAP call, as well as handle the retrieval
                    of user credentials.

            <subsection name="Security Considerations">
                <p>
                    Use of direct non-interactive authentication potentially
                    allows a service to harvest users' credentials. This is
                    a serious security consideration when a user accesses a
                    service from any organization other than the user's own
                    home organization. The Moria2 administrator will take care
                    to only allow this authentication method for trusted
                    services.
