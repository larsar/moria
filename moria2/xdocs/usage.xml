    <section name="Introduction">

      <p>
        Moria is implemented with a SOAP interface. The easiest way to use Moria is
        to use a SOAP implementation for the same programming language used
        by the service (that are going to use Moria). See the last section
        for more information about SOAP implementations for different programming
        languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Normally the SOAP implementation contains tools for generating stubs from
        the WSDL interface. The stubs works as the local representation of Moria
        and makes the communication between the web service and Moria totally transparent.
        How to use the stubs varies between SOAP implementations thus the SOAP
        implementation's documentation contains important documentation to understand
        how to use a web service as Moria.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section name="WSDL Interface">
      <p>
        The WSDL interface defines Moria's API and is best documented by 
        the WSDL it self and the
        <a href="moria-web/apidocs/index.html">Javadoc for the classes used to implement Moria</a>. A
        deployed Moria instance has it's own auto-generated WSDL, available via HTTP.
        For the URL to the WSDL file you should contact the administrators of the
        Moria installation you use.
      </p>
      <p>
        The different versions of the Moria API are backwards compatible.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Version 1.0">
        <p>
          Version 1.0 supports the <a href="design.html">regular Moria authentication</a> and verification of user
          existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="moria-web/apidocs/index.html">Javadoc for the implementation</a>
          describes the available methods in detail.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Version 1.1">
        <p>
          Version 1.1 extends the 1.0 version and also support the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Proxy authentication</li>
            <li>Utilities for user groups</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="moria-web/apidocs/index.html">Javadoc for the implementation</a>
          describes the available methods in detail.
