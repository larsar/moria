      <p>
        Moria is implemented as a <emph>web service</emph>, thus requires that
        the web service uses SOAP to talk to Moria. The easiest way to use Moria is
        to use a SOAP implementation for the same programming language used
        by the service (that are going to use Moria). See the last section
        for more information about SOAP implementations for different programming
        languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Normally the SOAP implementation contains tools for generating stubs from
        the WSDL interface. The stubs works as the local representation of Moria
        and makes the communication between the web service and Moria totally transparent.
        How to use the stubs varies between SOAP implementations thus the SOAP
        implementation's documentation contains important documentation to understand
        how to use a webservice as Moria.
