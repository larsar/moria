    <section name="Maven">
      <subsection name="Introduction">
	<p>
	  The build tool used for Moria is Maven.  Instructions on how
	  to install and use Maven can be found at Maven's official <a
	  href="http://maven.apache.org/">web site</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Moria has been divided into several modules.  Each such
	  module is configured as a separate Maven project.  Common
	  Maven goals as java:compile, test, site:generate and jar can
	  therefore be run in each separate module.
	</p>
	<p>
	  To minimize the effort needed to maintain the build
	  configuration and reduce the risks of inconsistencies
	  between the modules Moria make use of Maven's built in
	  support for property and POM inheritance.  Read more about
	  this in the Maven <a
	  href="http://maven.apache.org/reference/user-guide.html">user
	  guide</a>.
	</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Dependencies">
	<p>
	  Moria is dependent on a number of java packages, which again
	  may depend on other packages.  To manage the handling of the
	  many different jar files, Moria makes use of the fact the
	  POM is a xml document and defines all dependencies as
	  entities in an external document
	  called <em>dependencies.ent</em>.  Details surrounding this
	  setup can be found in the Maven <a
	  href="http://wiki.codehaus.org/maven/EnsureProjectConsistencyWithEntities">Wiki</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Most of Moria's dependencies are found in Mavens default
	  repository at <a
	  href="http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/">iBiblio</a>.  Other are
	  found in <a href="http://moria.sourceforge.net/maven/">our
	  own</a> repository at Sourceforge.
	</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Special goals">
	<p>
	  Some of the modules and the main project has spesial goals
	  defined their respective maven.xml files.  These goals are
	  documented where they are defined, but it can be mentioned
	  that the root project file contains goals for building,
	  deployment and site generation of the complete project.
	  These goals use the reactor directly and not the
	  multiproject plugin (this is primarily due to leagacy
	  reasons). All locally defined goals use a <em>project:</em>
	  prefix.
