            Configuration of the log API is basically limited to producing a
            suitable log4j configuration. See log4j's 
            <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/documentation.html">documentation</a>
            and the distributed examples for more information.

            <p>
            The only special case to consider is the access log. The logger's
            identifier will always the fully qualified path of the
            <code>AccessLogger</code> class itself. To isolate the access log it
            is therefore important to define the logger that catches the
            <code>AccessLogger</code> output before any other loggers catching
            output from the <code>no.feide.moria</code> hierarchy. Also, all
            logging from the <code>AccessLogger</code> is done at log4j level
            <code>WARN</code>, so to disable access logging define the log level
            at a higher level than this.
